Hi all. Apologies for the late notice. We would like T1 (especially ZID due to border proximity) for the SNO portion of our 24h. MIT package to follow shortly. 

@Matt H | I1 ZYZ is not essential but if you’re on, it would be much appreciated. I understand there’s an OTS going on for you guys at a similar time potentially so I get if you’re busy.
Matt H | I1 — 11/06/2025 11:40
The OTS is from 21-23 so that shouldn't be an issue, I'll put out your request for staffing though. 
Arya C | ZME DATM — 11/06/2025 11:41
Brilliant thanks. Good luck @Benjamin M | C1 ??
Hayden Y | ZID ATM — 11/06/2025 12:30
ofc I already have it out there in our monthly plan
for your planning we have alot of support events and only a few center controllers so it might be good to be aware of playbooks that miss us
Arya C | ZME DATM — 11/06/2025 13:01
Yeah starting this weekend we have events home and support 7 weekends in a row too so it’s a fun period ?? 
Arya C | ZME DATM — 11/09/2025 17:08
Will have preliminary TMIs out tomorrow or Tuesday
Arya C | ZME DATM — 11/10/2025 11:58

I recognise the MIT is definitely on the higher side but for what is essentially a single field SNO to a field with an AAR of 35-40 depending on conditions I think it'll prevent any horror shows initially, and we can always take another look midway if it ends up being too much work for our T1.
@Hayden Y | ZID ATM you were asking regarding routing; it seems like a big merge for you would be over the ROLNN# - prefroutes send ATL/CLT/RDU/RIC through there, might be something to coordinate with DC but since JST UPRRR TRYBE# is 'only' from PCT rerouting a few CLT for example straight through ZDC and missing ZID might be an option.
Arya C | ZME DATM — 11/10/2025 12:34
@Matt H | I1 since our TRYBE# stream will already be very busy, if you could route all your YYZ+ people to CLE via DOZRR BRWNZ4 (Simbrief gave me ANCOL5 GGUCE DOZRR BRWNZ4, not sure if that is what you want SID-wise) that would be much appreciated.
Hayden Y | ZID ATM — 11/10/2025 14:12
Yeah I’ll look at it and have some backup plans ready. I don’t anticipate needing to reroute but we’re getting pretty burnt out so it would be nice to know ahead of time what the backup plan is.
I’m gonna go ahead and pull an ACE for it tonight or tomorrow if I don’t get any traction cause I’d rather have one of our guys end up opening CMH or something than be 0 or 1 person staffing.
Either way we got you
Arya C | ZME DATM — 11/10/2025 14:14
I 10000% get it. I guess we're both in the situation of being Tier 1 city normally haha. But yeah I suspect ROKNN and ROLNN are going to be popping if ATL or CLT are staffed 
Hayden Y | ZID ATM — 11/10/2025 14:15
Yeah I’m seriously considering making a high only center from 24-60 so if we are solo one can open that alone.
Just for T1 one support haha
Arya C | ZME DATM — 11/10/2025 14:17
I won't be there on the night, @Nick S | ZOB I1 will be TMU and @Jonathan B | ZOB EC will be there as well, if you guys are absolutely slammed I'm sure we can tweak things a little bit once we get into it
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 11/13/2025 17:07
You guys get any signups?
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 11/14/2025 11:34
Also this is what we came up with for a preferred route, SID is obviously your choice but:
YYZ-CLE via ANCOL5 GGUCE DOZRR BRWNZ4
 
Arya C | ZME DATM — 11/14/2025 11:45
Central point for ZYZ if you are on (in accordance with the TRYBE STOP as above) is DOZRR BRWNZ4
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 11/14/2025 12:50
@Michael B | VATUSA5 any luck on a NTMO?
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 11/14/2025 13:13
00-04?
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 11/14/2025 13:13
Affirm
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 11/14/2025 13:14
@NTMO anyone able to come out?
If not I can try and make it work
Dean V | ZHU DATM

 — 11/14/2025 13:19
Tomorrow night? maybe
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 11/14/2025 13:19
This event has the potential to either be completely fine or very busy. Our AAR is 43 
Alex Y | ZNY I1 — 11/14/2025 13:21
I'll probably be around but I may be needed to cover ZNY staffing
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 11/14/2025 14:31
Scratch that... TAF shows IMC so AAR will be 32
Arya C | ZME DATM — 11/14/2025 15:16

Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 11/14/2025 18:09
@Nick S | ZOB I1 will be TMU. I'll also be available on the hotline as I will be CAB CIC.
Matt H | I1 — 11/15/2025 00:18
I’ve posted that routing for tonight alongside the TMI package, and based on conversations I’ve had we should have a few people who are around to help out. 

Anything else you need from us?
Arya C | ZME DATM — 11/15/2025 04:43
That should be all. Thank you so much!!!
Hayden Y | ZID ATM — 11/15/2025 15:50

Arya C | ZME DATM — 11/16/2025 02:59

The max AAR of 40 was always going to be a bit speculative but I'm glad it all came together. Thank you to all our neighbours for helping us out! Now time for the rest of the 24 hours....
Also congrats on the C1 @Benjamin M | C1 
Jonathan G | ZOB S2

Arya C | ZME DATM — 11/16/2025 13:20
That's great
So 40 takes into account the 24R/24L stagger which we didnt do
The real AAR in that config is like 32 lol 
even happier with that
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 11/16/2025 13:31
i can adjust then
