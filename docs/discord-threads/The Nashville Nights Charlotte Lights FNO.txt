I should be on center with @William P | ZDC C1 for the first half
Simon R | ZJX C1 — 11/11/2025 21:53
For ZJX would be @Kona and @Patrick M | ZJX EC
Hayden Y | ZID ATM — 11/11/2025 23:23
@Michael B | VATUSA5 @Timothy M | ZTL I1 @Eric S | ZME EC updated
Actually never mind I lied and said that on my way to do it but we aren’t on the staffing data page
We’ll be there though
Put us down as 1 and understaffed. I’ll pull up too if I don’t get FAAed for the first half.
Do I get extra points for doing the event from BNA on an overnight?
Eric S | ZME EC — 11/11/2025 23:29
i said this on the other thread but we will be requesting 10 MIT via BAMMA and 10 MIT via LENSE. nothing for the pasly for now. If there is little/no ATL traffic, this would likely drop
Eric S | ZME EC — 11/13/2025 01:30
We will be running our standard 3 way with our typical nashville east side only LO. We had some LO sectors changed in that area so I’ll the actual split map later
Timothy M | ZTL I1 — 11/13/2025 01:36
We’re not going to request any MIT at event start. The worst it’ll get is 15 if ZID starts giving us guys on the FILPZ as well
Eric S | ZME EC — 11/14/2025 11:06
high split
Image
lo split - only sector used will be 60 (+40), everything else goes to the high (lmk if more clarification needed)

Eric S | ZME EC — 11/14/2025 11:08
only affects ztl handoffs
Carson B | ZDC EC

 — 11/14/2025 11:10
ZDC will only have one center open but we will be open the full event.
Hayden Y | ZID ATM — 11/14/2025 17:48
I think @Richard S | ZID C3 will be our hotline tonight. I've a 4 am report time so I'll be sleeping.

I can see the ADR line, but not an AAR line. Are they coincident?

Michael B | VATUSA5 — 11/15/2025 13:12
Was kinda unlucky in the top graph the AAR is right at 20  but barely visible the second one they’re on top of each other
Nate J | ZAU C3 — 11/15/2025 13:14
Gotcha
William P | ZDC C1 — 11/15/2025 13:17
Where do you get this?
Simon R | ZJX C1 — 11/15/2025 13:55
PERTI page has AAR/DR for most fields
William P | ZDC C1 — 11/15/2025 14:07
I know it has that I mean those Grpahs
I dont see that in the PERTI
Simon R | ZJX C1 — 11/15/2025 14:14
Oh my bad. I think it’s made using statsim data? Not 100% on the how
Alex Y | ZNY I1 — 11/15/2025 14:33
It's a Google sheets tool I built, I can link it later
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 11/15/2025 17:10
Yeah it’s basically a spreadsheet with formulas setup to where u can copy paste statsim data into the sheet and convert it into a graph
Alex Y | ZNY I1 — 11/15/2025 17:16
here's the one from the 11/7 IAD event. You can make a copy into your own drive and then edit all the fields as necessary. In the Departures and Arrivals sheets, you delete everything and then copy-paste (with Ctrl+Shift+V to strip the formatting) the data from the Statsim table display and then on the Stats sheet edit cell A2 to the start time (I usually go -1 hour from event start) and edit columns J and L for the Planened AAR and ADR lines
