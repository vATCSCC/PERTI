how's everyone looking for staffing? @Jordan J | ZAB EC @Caution Wake Turbulence @Cameron N | ZLC ATM @Zhenyu M | ZOA S3 @Eiso W | ZOA S2
Caution Wake Turbulence — 01/14/2026 13:15
We got a crap ton of staffing. I ended up opening other positions that are not our usual. Great enroute staffing.
Brody B | ZLA EC — 01/14/2026 13:17
great to hear!
Justin L | ZAB C3 — 01/14/2026 16:20
ZAB staffing looks pretty good. I was going to put my name in for the ZAB DCC rep but I got assigned a trip that finishes right at event start (if we're not delayed). I'll miss the first hour but I'll see if someone can cover it until I get home. If not I can give one of our centers the TS login info or you can just coordinate directly with them
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 01/14/2026 18:22
ZLC looks good.

I’ll make pass back tonight @Hayden | ZSE EC
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/16/2026 15:36
@Hayden | ZSE EC lets just do 35 MIT per stream (PDX vs SEA), APREQ lower based on demand, fixes seem to vary a bit 
if BAARB/RUFUS  is used thatd be optimal for a fix but its not the most common routes as of today
Image

maybe use that LKV BAARB route to make em merge easier, but i doubt the juice is worth the squeeze with that one

Brody B | ZLA EC — 01/16/2026 19:36
do y'all need our split on the perti tool?
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/16/2026 19:41
It's broken rn but once I fix it, you can add it. Just lookout for an "it's fixed" message

ZDV HIGH Split Map. ZDV will have a low center, it is combined. Anything AOB FL260 goes to 11 - Junction Low.

Adam E | ZLC FE — 01/16/2026 21:58
Are we using TYEGR at all or all GGAPP? From DEN 
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/16/2026 21:59
Try scheduling your split in the main perti.vatcscc.org/splits site now while it's up & running
Brody B | ZLA EC — 01/16/2026 22:01
it's usually never used, right?
Caution Wake Turbulence — 01/16/2026 22:01
Brody and I talked about this. Nothing departing DEN to any L30 airport will go through ZLC. Everything is staying ZDV 
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/16/2026 22:01
You can try https://vatcscc-backup.azurewebsites.net/splits if the main site is too slow

i completely forgot about this -- need to correct TMIs

Justin L | ZAB C3 — 01/16/2026 22:33
Planned ZAB split. Still no joy on finding someone to cover TMU until I show up (hopefully) about an hour in. If it comes to it I can join the teamspeak on my drive home or if y'all want to just coordinate directly with our centers until then that works too
Image
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 01/16/2026 22:52
Honestly, If ZLC is slow, I might be able to help NOM or something

Justin L | ZAB C3 — 01/17/2026 10:37
@Brody B | ZLA EC ZAB will probably start with 15 MIT per stream over TENTS, WOTRO, SCOLE, and HOGGZ. We're having to shift around some positions so we might be a little understaffed for the first hour or two. If we can lower it back to LOA/10MIT later on we will
Brody B | ZLA EC — 01/17/2026 10:44
got it
Elliott B | ZLA C1 — 01/17/2026 14:14
where can you get this report?

its pulled from flightaware data

zoa has made something that basically copies that data into an ids website for quick look up
Justin L | ZAB C3 — 01/17/2026 16:12
ZAB will also be only in a 2-way split for the first hour or so. Our centers will let you know the split when they get on
Brody B | ZLA EC — 01/17/2026 16:18
got it
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/17/2026 17:58
Ah I see…I’ll get on then??

yeah ZSE is cooked rn lmao

What AAR are we expecting
Brody B | ZLA EC — 01/17/2026 18:00
shooting for 64
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/17/2026 18:01
Kk
Brody B | ZLA EC — 01/17/2026 18:02
do y'all have a split
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/17/2026 18:06
oh thought it was already posted mb

feel like i did the GS wrong but NCT GS to ZOA 0230-0315 medium chance of extension

Ken G | ZOA DATM — 01/31/2026 12:01
Interesting — I want to look at the compliance with the Replay as well, because some numbers seem a bit off (e.g. 0.1nm spacing between 2 aircraft to FLCHR) unless something else is going on
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 01/31/2026 12:04
It is missing the ZLC TMI as well. I also noticed that TMI construction plays a part as well.  Ex the ZLC TMI via HHOOD for the PDX event was showing a lot of non complicance because the TMI was vague.
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/31/2026 17:05
Please do & lmk what you find
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/31/2026 17:06
I was working hard on getting parsing better yesterday. I’ll continue working so it catches TMIs better sometime this week
Ken G | ZOA DATM — 01/31/2026 17:38
A few things I've observed just from spot checking some of the red pairs and using the rings on https://vatsim-replay.com/2026-01-17-escape-to-the-desert

UAL751 -> DAL1690: Tool reports 9.5nm but the a/c are never within 10nm of each other as merging. When DAL1690 crosses the border to ZLA, it's 15nm between (still fails the MIT compliance, I know :P)
SWA805 -> DAL305: Tool reports 1.2nm but these two aren't even next to each other in the stream, there's 4 planes in the middle and DAL305 is earlier.
DAL305 -> UAL1583: Tool reports 0.1nm but like above, these two aren't even next to each other. UAL1583 is ahead of ACA557 who is ahead of DAL305 in the stream.
UPS75 -> PHX70: I don't even see a PHX70 in the replay data, so I'm not sure what happened here. And UPS75 doesn't cross the border until 0318 but the tool is reporting 0221
DAL242 -> FDX5397: Tool reports 7.6nm but I'm seeing FDX5397 cross the border with 18-20 MIT
ITY759 -> TAM1992: I don't see these two in the FLCHR stream at all in the replay data
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/31/2026 17:39
K i'll investigate
Ken G | ZOA DATM — 01/31/2026 17:39
All that being said, a) this is very cool, b) I can understand this being quite challenging to do perfectly especially once we start vectoring for sequence and space, c) I think it can be useful even if it's not perfect 
Also I think it's missing a lot of pairs in general. E.g., the timeline is showing a 212 nm gap in the middle of the event and I can guarantee, having worked the sector that handed off FLCHRs to ZLA for this event, that it was never that quiet ??
