ZOB will have an OTS going on, likely in one of our northeast sectors. 

Considering yesterday’s FNO, we’d like ZAU to be on. ZMP can take the day off though. There will also be N90/BOS passback for ZID.
Cameron P | ZBW EC — 01/03/2026 16:52
@Daniel G | ZBW I1 @Evan M | ZBW I1
Hayden Y | ZID ATM — 01/06/2026 08:50
You know we’ll be there!
Nathan P | C3 — 01/19/2026 20:22
Any interest in adding CAN to this? Specifically probs the CZQ and CZY (maybe CZU)? CZQ will be staffing anyway
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/19/2026 20:36
Up to @Jonathan B | ZOB EC CAN is technically T2 in this instance
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/20/2026 07:43
wait why is it up to me?
ZOB is just support
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/20/2026 07:54
Cuz ur Toronto’s neighbor 
So it’s up to u if u want them on
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/20/2026 07:55
I have no issue with it
@Emmanuel G | ZOB S3 ^
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/20/2026 08:38
@Matt H | I1 we will have a center OTS going on and will be requesting passback
Matt H | I1 — 01/20/2026 14:47
sounds good, I'll pass on the message.
Matt H | I1 — 01/20/2026 15:26
@Jonathan B | ZOB EC once you have TMIs could you ping both myself and @Zihao Z | SUP cause I'm quite pre-occupied with exams at the moment
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/20/2026 15:27
wilco
Thomas V | ZOB DATM — 01/23/2026 13:05

Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/23/2026 13:33
Wasnt that the one you failed ??
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/23/2026 13:33
No that was Boston
??
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/23/2026 13:33
Ahhhhh
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/23/2026 13:34
Lesson learned... do NOT rebuild PC the day before C1 OTS
(and forget to reinstall half the things you need)
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/23/2026 13:35
Oh I remember that ?? ?? ??
Thomas V | ZOB DATM — 01/23/2026 17:09
Still can’t believe you use Navigraph for controlling.
It’s too clunky for me to look fast
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/23/2026 17:27
That’s been my gripe with using it for controlling too. What do you use instead? Just Skyvector?
Thomas V | ZOB DATM — 01/23/2026 17:50
Our alias system.
We have a chart recall built in
Via fe buddy. .jfki2lc for instance will bring up the ILS 22L chart at jfk. Works with any FAA  airport. Like .oqnr27 brings up Brandywine regional rnav 27 or .n27r26 brings up Pottstown Muni Rnav 26. 

These all pop in your browser so you easily close them
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/23/2026 17:54
https://reference.oakartcc.org/charts
ZOA has this
Can put it any FAA airport think it pulls from flight aware
Thomas V | ZOB DATM — 01/23/2026 17:57
I love popping it right from eram or stars
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/23/2026 18:24
Oh that’s really nice. But just making sure, that’s local to ZOB right? If so, I could talk to our FE about getting something of the like implemented with us
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/23/2026 18:37
Yeah it’s local
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/23/2026 18:43
Neat. @Matthew B | ZNY FE sorry for the ping, but do you think this is a project that can be put on the list down the line?
Matthew B | ZNY FE — 01/23/2026 18:46
We can look into that, sure. But we do also have our IDS in development too so we can see if it's even necessary depending on how that ends up working out.
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/23/2026 18:46
Perfect. Whichever works best, and I’m sure there’d be a way to incorporate it into the IDS and kill two birds with one stone. Thanks Matt!

Dude I just tubed and had to close ??
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/25/2026 18:21
Looked like most centers were solo
Not surprised
Alex Y | ZNY I1 — 01/25/2026 19:14
I did about 45 minutes on the JFK N90 sector and landed only about 10 planes before quitting. The ability to follow instructions was the worst I've seen it maybe ever, taking a minute+ to start a turn, turning significantly-less-than-standard rates, and a complete inability to maintain assigned speed which resulted in multiple cancelled approaches and resequences because someone was doing either 100 over the ground or 220 over the ground on the same track at the same "180" kts
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/25/2026 19:19
pilot quality has tanked...fast
i wish my recording of the event yesterday had my messages window open, i was at a point if after 2 tries u didn't respond, i typed out the instruction and even then half of them 5 mins later blocked me asking for a descent
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/25/2026 19:28
The quality and competence were absolutely unacceptable today. I had to quit center after only like 90 minutes earlier, and barely survived working approach just now. I agree with Alex that this was the worst I’ve ever seen, even during our busiest events.
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/26/2026 03:06
Can we pre-reserve a supervisor for the event ??
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/26/2026 03:19
Think there’s a ticket I can put in for it have to reread that conversation in staff chat
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/26/2026 10:10
We won't be doing our OTS after all, with the mock event last night he passed ??

Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/28/2026 11:51
Just FYI, we will have high MITs to Kennedy during the event. This is to both discourage flooding Kennedy as well as provide relief due to staffing issues in that area of N90. 

If (when) pilots complain, they are more than welcome to go to EWR or even LGA if demand allows.
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/28/2026 12:03
We talking 35 or like….more
Alex Y | ZNY I1 — 01/28/2026 12:04
JFK (cab and radar total) currently has 2 controllers assigned to staff it so... more...
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/28/2026 12:05
Should I drop ZOB and do JFK tower instead ?? what’s the equation
It’s fine, we can do holding stacks for days if we need ??
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/28/2026 13:18
Now 3, but still not great lol. Thanks Arya for switching to cover JFK TWR ??
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/28/2026 13:18
/s of course, hopefully that helps
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/28/2026 13:20
Not seen since I transferred 2 weeks ago ??
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/28/2026 13:20
@Kevin H | ZAU EC If this turns into a N90 stream from C90 again it could result in a ground stop.

Our response to pilot #65 who asks for IFR to Kennedy
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/28/2026 13:21
We're going to be holding JFK guys, can almost guarantee it ??
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/28/2026 13:22
At least there’s a published hold at HOXIE

@Daniel | ZNY EC What route are you guys planning for JFK - DCA? 

Are you guys able to put them on the CLIPR and stop the DEALE? 

And I am guessing you guys would prefer all DCA from BOS through the DEALE?
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/28/2026 16:29
Absolutely, that's the plan
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/28/2026 16:36

could you put your requested routes into SB so it saves time for reroutes?
at least the MCO/ORL/JAX ones, any others in the air from elsewhere we can reroute airborne
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/29/2026 11:06
I read that as SweatBox at first????
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/29/2026 11:24
@Alex Y | ZNY I1 any chance you can do this? I don’t know how to lol
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/29/2026 12:33
Send the routes
Alex Y | ZNY I1 — 01/29/2026 12:58
they're in the ZNY TMI Plan doc pages 4-6 with the draft advisories
Alex Y | ZNY I1 — 01/29/2026 12:59
only a few NTMOs have access, but we can enter routes into SimBrief and mark them as event TMU routes with a limited valid time. Looks like Michael's got these covered

Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/29/2026 23:17
@Alex Y | ZNY I1 just to clarify, this is the route I'm going to update it with as per the PRD:
DITCH LUIGI HNNAH Q450 JFK ROBUC3
Alex Y | ZNY I1 — 01/29/2026 23:26
No, this is the reroute over MERIT to put PHL traffic with N90 instead of ZDC overflights
DITCH LUIGI HNNAH MERIT ROBUC3
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/29/2026 23:29
Ah okay, we don't have that in the PRD so I will save this somewhere for future reference
Zihao Z | SUP — 01/29/2026 23:51
k, nothing for N90 or PCT?

@Jonathan B | ZOB EC we'd definitely like to talk with you all on whats best for you with in-trail restrictions for BOS.

ideally wed pick a fix on the boundary like only AUDIL...PONCT. so that way you are able to just clear direct a fix at the boundary to hit MIT. Think this was the first time we did a PER STREAM and we struggled a ton hitting our internal restrictions.
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/30/2026 22:47
We usually like to give dct PONCT, so having AS ONE would actually work nice for us
we have the airspace to handle it
Cameron P | ZBW EC — 01/30/2026 22:48

Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/30/2026 23:47
only comment i really was gate delay at DCA wasn't really correctly executed, demand short of the runway was lacking overall, which didnt effectively provide planes in the air to BOS.William P already knows bout this but for future events/usage of gatehold, some planes need to be kept at the runway so there's some demand to go in case MIT decreases or a GS lifts. Waiting until MIT is lowered to push wastes time in the air that people (could've) worked pretty hard to create
other feedback i heard was general freq congestion at BOS, consistent throughout the entire event, lots of blocking each other and general congestion. apparently caused some undue delay off the gate
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/30/2026 23:48
yall are so brave for dat...but do u??
Carson B | ZDC EC

Yup! Ill make sure to talk it over with GND as to some better ways to do some of that stuff. We also plan on making a document that describes these procedures

The disconnection data is fascinating. I'm not sure what specifically can be done about it... People want to file and fly their favorite airport pair even if there are more airports advertised... But, off the cuff anyway, something here feels actionable to help improve the pilot experience which can be corroborated via reduced disconnect metrics... I just can't put my finger on it at the moment.
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/31/2026 07:22
I agree. I think it provides a good (or better than what we were looking at before) idea about actual demand
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/31/2026 08:08
Seconding (or thirding?) that. Really nice new metric because I definitely had a handful disconnect that had filed for DCA
Too bad that's not a metric applicable to me in the real-world
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/31/2026 08:09
Just lmk when you need me to call your facility & notify you of a ... threat /s /j (for legal purposes)
Matt B | ZJX C3 — 01/31/2026 08:09
Does "disconnected" take into account pre-files that didnt fly? or only people who "connected" and then proceeded to "disconnect" at some point
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/31/2026 08:10
Connect, then disconnect (didn't complete flight)
Nate J | ZAU C3 — 01/31/2026 08:11
How granular is the data? Length of time connected? Location of disconnection?
Matt B | ZJX C3 — 01/31/2026 08:14
It is fascinating, but impossible to accurately pinpoint reasons without some sort of disconnect poll ?? 
Some random reasons I can think of off the top of my head are sim issues, aircraft issues, stuff comes up at their house that they cant complete the flight, new pilots who thought they can do it and realized they are way above their head, delays due to taxi time and/or ground stops, etc.

A good initial judge of this is lets compare this data tonight after the SNO in FL, I bet the disconnect numbers follow a similar pattern. 
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/31/2026 08:15
This is what it does now but I'm noticing a "close-enough" measure for disconnected vs arrived that I'm digging deeper on (maybe using ON times):
?
How the system determines if a flight "disconnected" vs "never showed up":

The simple test: Did we ever see the plane's position on the radar?

Scenario 1: Prefile that never flew

Pilot filed a flight plan (like making a reservation)
Never actually logged into the simulator to fly it
System never received any position data (latitude/longitude)
Status stays as "prefile" — they just didn't show up
Scenario 2: Disconnected mid-flight

Pilot filed a flight plan AND connected to fly
System was receiving their position updates (we could see them on radar)
Then they stopped sending updates for 5+ minutes
They were still far from their destination (50+ nm away)
Status becomes "disconnected" — they left mid-journey
Scenario 3: Actually arrived

Same as above, but when they stopped reporting...
They were close to their destination (less than 50nm away)
Status becomes "arrived" — they probably just landed and logged off

The key difference: The system checks if there's any position data in the adl_flight_position table. If lat IS NULL (no coordinates ever recorded), the pilot never connected — they're a no-show prefile, not a disconnect.
?
Nate J | ZAU C3 — 01/31/2026 08:18
Oooh, a disconnect poll... That sounds like a fascinating potential addition to vPilot
"It appears you didn't complete your filed flight, would to care to provide a reason?"
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/31/2026 08:20
I'm gonna update & backfill the disconnect parameters:
?
1. Check for ON time first
2. Change proximity threshold to 10NM
?
Thomas V | ZOB DATM — 01/31/2026 08:20
It would be interesting to know if they never left the gate. I’m sure that could be figured out and that’s actionable. I know I ended up being a D/C because of that myself. I had a SIM crash and I might have missed my call for push because I wasn’t going to an event field on my arrival end. 

When it reconnected after about 40 minutes, I’m not being able to get a word into ground I gave up and started event suping to help the chaos
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/31/2026 08:22
Also I updated the demand page. You can multi-filter by given filters (the buttons) + flight_status (e.g., see which disconnects were ROBUC flights) & set time window to custom values
Matt B | ZJX C3 — 01/31/2026 08:23
I like this, I noticed some pilots were landing and then disconnecting as soon as they exited runway (which I assume is they were under time constraints and had to ATL+F4)
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/31/2026 08:23
I say can but now it's not splitting the ORIG filter right... hold on
Matt B | ZJX C3 — 01/31/2026 08:38
Looking back at past data for BOS...the disconnect percentage was very close to this event vs a NON event day (snowstorm) last weekend. Interesting note is the snowstorm straffic was over a 12hr period vs FNO a 4 hour period, the percentage was still very close.

Snowstorm had a disconnect percentage of about 34% of arrived flights
NEC FNO had a disconnect percentage of about 35% of arrived flights

If you want to play around with data make sure you select "Custom" on the time range
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/31/2026 09:30
I think this is fixed now. All counts look consistent

Dunno about PERTI
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/31/2026 12:56
Yeah
Matthew W | ZBW C1 — 01/31/2026 14:09
People have disconnected from every VATSIM event in its entire history. What exactly would you do differently to stop the few that did due to volume or TMIs? Those things are both inescapable.
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/31/2026 14:17
yeah without the context of why the pilots disconnected the numbers could be misleading, even if we did know, all 3 airports were at capacity for at least minus LGA, and LGA wasnt even due to TMIs its just not enough people straight up flew there
Matt B | ZJX C3 — 01/31/2026 14:45
From what I looked at earlier I don’t think any correlation exists between TMIs and disconnect flights. I think it just happens all the time, just more noticeable in events because there are more airplanes.
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 01/31/2026 15:01
Could always test that given enough data
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/31/2026 17:04
I’ll take a look at that later. I think we have the data. I should
But I agree it will be misleading without asking pilots why they disco’d
Also discos are my fav form of TMI. We don’t even have to log it.
Matthew W | ZBW C1 — 02/01/2026 01:36
I can't say I've logged data, but I have worked thousands if not tens of thousands of airplanes on the network. I'd say the number of pilots who disconnect and tell me beforehand that they are disconnecting due some sort of delay is maybe 1%, certainly single digits. Some of those mention they were time constrained and any delay meant they were unable to complete the flight and they were just hoping it would go smoothly. 

A majority of pilots just disconnect without giving a reason. Sometimes it's during delay vectors or after a hold is issued, sometimes it's not. Usually when you start doing things that aren't letting the airplane fly its route in LNAV/VNAV (holds, vectors, speed control, etc.) you get some amount of disconnects. I assume a percentage of those are just because they don't know how to handle the situation and would rather not get yelled at for violating the CoC.
The immediate thought that comes to mind for solutions is to be upfront and encourage pilots who do not want delays to avoid event airports and busy parts of the event airspace. 
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 02/06/2026 17:38
Updated this to include @Ken G | ZOA DATM's more granular trajectories (also updated my own data collection to store 15-sec trajectories) & redesign the UI.
