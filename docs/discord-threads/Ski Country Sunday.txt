Looking at weather, high perssure firmly over the rockies.  No precip anywhere in Sight
FG might be the only concern
Planning on the following:
JAC 19: AAR 16
BZN 12: AAR 20
SUN ODO 13: AAR 10 - visuals.

I'm thinking a FCA BZN_NO_TOCUD for ZDV people. ASE/EGE/GJT TCH..SABAT.LOSST1 DEN and CPR: CZI..POWDA.POWDA1
TMI Plans for us. all to ZDV.
JAC via CZI, DDY 30 MIT per stream to start. will evaluate if we need as one.
BZN via CZI 25 MIT.
SUN, 5MINIT per stream. 
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/09/2025 15:07
SUN is historically not super popular, so if demand isn't there, will plan on just letting it buck.  Will mitigate volume with holding

Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/10/2025 18:50
Evan, do you think traffic will be crossfire style or from everywhere?
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/10/2025 21:22
Biggest cross fire I expect is to/from EGE/ASE and JAC.
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/10/2025 21:27
Put black freq on the low diagram
I can't actually read that area 6 freq
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/10/2025 21:36
Heres starting MIT thoughts:
ASE: 35 MIT via HYPPE, ERRDA on the LOYYD#. (Non-rnav aircraft 35 MIT via ALL)
EGE: 25-30 MIT via OCS CHE RLG
GJT: 10 MIT Via All as one
CPR: 10 MIT via all as one.

@Cameron N | ZLC ATM
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 00:30
SK1?
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 00:34
For routings?
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 00:34
Yeah
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 00:34
yes and no
ASE is how we want it on there but do to how our sectorization is for low center the EGE routes we dont want them on the star
Image
This is how the route will go. In that short distance they will go through 3 different centers
would like to keep it just to 2 (the high  then low)
Thinking EGE via OCS (J163) EKR RLG on the ZDV side
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 00:43
could just tunnel
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 00:43
That too
Would help a lot
just OCS AOB FL260
Plus with that route the ASE and EGE departures have plenty of room to climb
Only required routings we have is;
ASE: Via LOYYD1 STAR if they are RNAV capable
EGE: OCS (J163) CHE RLG 
rest are fine as normal 
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 00:46
ALPIN4 BPI OCS J163 CHE
That is the JAC/EGE route
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 00:47
need the RLG in there. Its an IAF and keeps them out of a different centers airspace
The final fix for EGE arrivals kinda need to be RLG or DUCES if they are coming from ZLC
Works for airspace and all IAFs
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 00:49
Actually wait
That isn't what they flew
They went to HYPPE

From what i've heard the ZDV/ZLC LOA is the only one with it being required for ski country airports to be on the new stars.
Would need to update that LOA for us
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 01:09
But PRESN or MENIN is fine too
OCS DNW for JAC People
They gonna get vectored anyways.
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 01:11
So thoughts for all BZN arrivals- 
EGE: BEVVR1/APRES2 SPRKT EKR J173 TCH SABAT LOSST1
ASE: LINDZ1 LINDZ JNC TCH SABAT LOSST1
GJT: GRAND2 JNC TCH SABAT LOSST1
CPR: CPR3 CZI POWDA POWDA1
DEN: XXWNG1 XXWNG CZI POWDA POWDA1 
want to add DEN to that?
actually yeah we will
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 01:14
Even CPR departures? OCS brings them pretty out of the way
can do CPR3 BOY DNW
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 01:15
Nah
DDY DNW if you want
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 01:16
They'd just go direct to DNW from the tracon any ways
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 01:16
Yep
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 01:16
DDY isnt really useful as its to the NE of the airport
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 01:16
DNW
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 01:16
ahh just CPR3 DDY DNW and expect just direct to DNW given from the tracon
can also just do CPR3 DNW
Ill put it as CPR3 DDY DNW though
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 01:19
Image
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 01:20
That looks good to me. Takes 5 airports and gives them 2 points to merge and 2 different STARS
plus non of that really would be in the way of arrivals

is CKW DNW good for den departures to JAC? Or want to do same thing and do DDY DNW
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 01:23
ckw dnw WORKS
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 01:23
k
thats the default simbrief so dont need another reroute there
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 01:23
Yep
Lets just hope we crossfire lol
And a huge group doesn't come out of ZLA
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 01:24
oh yeah.
Ill be on ASE for the event and kinda will try to TMU. But I may be the one down the shitter
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 01:25
Like I said.
I don't expect SUN to be busy
bc that runway can't handle anything bigger than a a319
So I can maybe TMU
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 01:25
I guarentee you we'll get a 777 or similar at ASE 
With the theme though I do expect lot of PJs
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 01:30
well I think we have a good plan here
We can be ready to GS if there is a big mess from ZLA or something
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 01:34
Looks like simbrief gives SUN MENIN for EGE and GJT. ASE puts them on the SLTAN.YAWNY while CPR gives direct to PRESN. That good for you?
or we want to have the reroutes all onto the YAWNY?
I dont want to over complicate it if we dont have too. Lot of work for the ground controllers
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 01:35
That's fine
Will plan on adjusting if we need something different
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 01:36
Roger
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 01:36
I'm planning on visuals
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 01:40
Ill put in here the ZDV to ZLC routings. Cameron can you get your side and figure out the departure part of yall and put them we can can have DCC staff add them to simbrief?
Arrivals for BZN (Also see here):
ASE: LINDZ1 LINDZ JNC TCH SABAT LOSST1
EGE: BEVVR1/APRES2 SPRKT EKR J173 TCH SABAT LOSST1
GJT: GRAND2 JNC TCH SABAT LOSST1
CPR: CPR3 CZI POWDA POWDA1

Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/11/2025 23:14
What MIT can we expect for ZDV to ZLC?
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/11/2025 23:26
?20251214 Ski Country Sunday?
Add OCS to 30 MIT per stream
SUN, idk.  I'm not a believer it will be busy.  I may just opt to let sun buck to start and offset the TMI by an hour
Adam E | ZLC FE — 12/13/2025 15:14
Whole time

Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 01:55
@Michael B | VATUSA5 Can you add the event routings into simbrief.
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 12/14/2025 02:19
yeah
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 12/14/2025 02:19
just these
done
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 02:29
@Michael B | VATUSA5 these too
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 12/14/2025 02:34
kk
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 12/14/2025 02:35
DMW isnt in the current AIRAC
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 02:40
DNW lol
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 03:00
Also I dont see a complete list for ZLC-ZDV routes
@Cameron N | ZLC ATM can you get that?
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 03:11
Idk what Cameron wants for in ZLC and the departures but heres what the ZDV side of the routes need to be. 

ASE needs to enter ZDV via HYPPE, SLAPE, or ERRDA so they can be on the LOYYD1. 

EGE needs to enter ZDV via OCS CHE RLG
and CPR/GJT can be what ever
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/14/2025 07:33
Depends on Config at BZN and JAC.
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/14/2025 07:42
JAC-ASE: ALPIN4 BPI HYPPE LOYYD1
BZN-ASE: BGSKY2 DBS HYPPE LOYYD1
SUN-ASE: FLYIN1 GDWIN HYPPE LOYYD1

JAC-EGE: ALPIN4 BPI OCS J163 CHE RLG
BZN-EGE: BOBKT5 BOY CKW CHE RLG
SUN-EGE: FLYIN1 GDWIN HYPPE AAVON1
I feel like all of those will be the defaults except BZN & JAC to EGE.
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 11:05
For the SUN-EGE can you still put them on OCS CHE RLG? With that arrival and our sectorization it’d bring them between 3 controllers in span of 50 miles. Rather keep it simple with going through just 1 controller and one fix to meter them too
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 11:08
And also Cameron when it comes time to post the MIT can you post ours as well? I won’t be home till just before event stat
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/14/2025 11:18
Yeah. I can post in NTML
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 11:19
Thanks!
Also confirming y’all are good for doing the tunnel for all EGE arrivals? Just AOB FL260 to get to low
Daniel K | ZLC C1 — 12/14/2025 11:24
Did we ever confirm these were the MIT restrictions to ZDV from ZLC?
I'm working on an event brief for ZLC as I'm typing
just wanna make sure
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 11:25
Yes that is the up to date MIT for us
Daniel K | ZLC C1 — 12/14/2025 11:25
Copy thx
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 11:25
Also if you can put in the tunnel for the brief that’d be great
Daniel K | ZLC C1 — 12/14/2025 11:26
wilco
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 11:27
@Michael B | VATUSA5 ca you put theses in with the exception of SUN-EGE. Just replace the HYPPE.AAVON with OCS CHE RLG
Daniel K | ZLC C1 — 12/14/2025 11:29
@Evan M | ZDV ATM just so I write it correctly we agreed to throw EGE arrivals below 260 straight to low?
for the tunnel?
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 11:41
Yes. 260 at the boarder
We only have 1 high center so will help their work load
I got to go and won’t be around till event. Can someone make sure the ZLC-ZFV routes are put into simbrief as stated above with the SUN-EGE fix
Daniel K | ZLC C1 — 12/14/2025 11:46
Copy thx
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 11:50
@DCC Staff can someone get these Simbrief routes in?
Simon R | ZJX C1 — 12/14/2025 12:30
Yup one sec
Simon R | ZJX C1 — 12/14/2025 12:38
Done.
Adam E | ZLC FE — 12/14/2025 12:42
The Jackson Hole Route Is Missing The SID
Simon R | ZJX C1 — 12/14/2025 12:45
I have no way to define SID’s
Adam E | ZLC FE — 12/14/2025 12:45
Ah ok
Daniel K | ZLC C1 — 12/14/2025 12:49
I don't know if this is a VATUSA thing or one of the ECs has to complete but it appears the event isn't on the VATSIM event calendar? 
Daniel K | ZLC C1 — 12/14/2025 12:59
Hey fyi @Evan M | ZDV ATM when you're back we lost a center controller so this will be primarily split for ZLC
Image
for entire event
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 12/14/2025 13:07
Sry I’m awake now lol
Yall good? @Simon R | ZJX C1
Simon R | ZJX C1 — 12/14/2025 13:29
Yar
Brandon W | VATUSA2 — 12/14/2025 14:04
Is this the most up to date MIT request for ZLC:ZDV?
Brandon W | VATUSA2 — 12/14/2025 14:05
.......bruh...who forgot to post this
Daniel K | ZLC C1 — 12/14/2025 14:09
lmao
I'm a little thankful because I can only assume how much traffic I'd be getting at JAC with it up lol
Evan M | ZDV ATM

 — 12/14/2025 14:11
Must’ve been Blake. I was told everything was good when he left
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/14/2025 14:31
Considering enroute volume. I'm going to say 5 MIT all ZLC for the time being.
Aka, No MIT
ZDV looks busier.
Will post FCASK1_MOD once I get home
Casey P | ZDV TA — 12/14/2025 19:57
I don't think that's fair.
Blake R | ZSE C3 — 12/14/2025 20:16
I did not post into the VATSIM events calendar because if staffing sign-ups were too low, I was going to cancel.  In fairness, I was recommending cancelling when I retired, but left it up to the staff to decide.

So, it can be a #blameblake if you choose.  I wanted to be sure there was an out due to the complex staffing requirements for that type of event. 
Daniel K | ZLC C1 — 12/14/2025 20:16
Don't worry about it, not too concerned tbh
I wasn't able to be around the entire event unfortunately but I heard was a big hit either way
But yeah we can just #blameblake this one, not a huge deal
Blake R | ZSE C3 — 12/14/2025 20:18
It's a VATSIM tradition to blame the person who just left.  Embrace the traditions
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/14/2025 21:01
Casey P | ZDV TA — 12/14/2025 21:12
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 12/14/2025 22:10
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 12/15/2025 07:58
But all in all, I felt it went well.  Traffic looked okay.  Most I counted at ASE was 19 filed, and maybe 14 in the air.
JAC was consistent 10-15.
I tired visuals at SUN. Everyone turned that down and requested RNAV Y 31...
Graham D | OBS — 12/15/2025 15:34
I was VFR into sun for this one but fwiw whenever I have tried to take a visual there I have ended up really high so would have done the same. Field is kind of tucked round the valley bend and so I never get it in sight until too close for the mva, not sure if that's just a simism.
