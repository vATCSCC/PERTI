# OpenAPI Specs

The Postman-generated stub files have been moved to `_deprecated/`.

## Canonical OpenAPI Spec Locations

| API | Location |
|-----|----------|
| **PERTI API** | `api-docs/openapi.yaml` |
| **SWIM API** | `docs/swim/openapi.yaml` |

The specs in those locations are the complete, authoritative OpenAPI specifications.

## Deprecated Stubs

The files in `_deprecated/` are empty stubs auto-generated by Postman and can be safely deleted.
