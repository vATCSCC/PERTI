William P | ZDC C1 — 12/30/2025 13:59
Any MITs for ZDC
Alex Y | ZNY I1 — 12/30/2025 15:03
There definitely will be, @Daniel | ZNY EC do you have an ETA for draft TMIs?
Daniel | ZNY EC — 12/30/2025 15:05
Working on them once I get home
Daniel | ZNY EC — 12/30/2025 17:02
Preliminary in-trails available now: ?No Access

Hoping I'll be able to reduce the JFK numbers once I have a more accurate report as we get closer to Friday. @William P | ZDC C1 @Cameron P | ZBW EC @Jonathan B | ZOB EC

Will have ZBWs stuff sorted either tomorrow evening/Thursday morning
William P | ZDC C1 — 12/30/2025 19:54
Can we do 35 over PANZE into JFK instead of HOGGS. Looking over routing PCT deps into JFK don't go over HOGGS they merge in at PANZE from ACY
@Meg B | ZTL EC Were looking at doing CFR out of CLT. Thoughts?
Meg B | ZTL EC — 12/31/2025 10:19
That makes sense - hopefully we'll have the staffing to do that.
@Daniel | ZNY EC this event didn't get automatically pulled by the API for us from the vatsim calendar. I'll manually add it so no biggie. But I think there's some missing info on the vatsim event page for this event so it didn't get captured.
Daniel | ZNY EC — 12/31/2025 10:36
Ah yeah, I bet it's because we didn't specifically put in any event fields this time (trying not to list particular fields). Sorry about that
William P | ZDC C1 — 12/31/2025 13:07
Ok sounds good

ZOB passbacks from ZBW to N90 airports( @Jonathan B | ZOB EC )

ZBW is also putting out MIT for our ROBUC# arrivals into BOS to help deal with the high enroute load that will already be acquired from working the NY arrivals (the sector working ROBUCs is also working the PARCHs into JFK). If it becomes an issue for you guys just give us a shout ( @Daniel | ZNY EC )
Arya C | ZME DATM — 12/31/2025 18:14
@Matt H | I1 if you have a person on it would be appreciated; we'll have passback for you for the N90 streams
Matt H | I1 — 12/31/2025 18:27
I've put out the request, I'd imagine we should have a couple of people around
Arya C | ZME DATM — 12/31/2025 18:28
Thanks!
Hayden Y | ZID ATM — 01/01/2026 14:44
@Arya C | ZME DATM Any passback?
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/01/2026 14:44
Negative. Y'all can take the evening off ??
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/01/2026 18:20
Sorry for the delay - yes, will update that. Actually reducing the JFK in-trails for ZBW/ZOB since the TAFs seem to be favoring 31s which is our highest capacity config
William P | ZDC C1 — 01/01/2026 18:21
ok cool, thank you!
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/01/2026 18:22
Np! Also actually am reducing your in-trails too ??
William P | ZDC C1 — 01/01/2026 18:23
Works for me!

@Tyler C | C1 Will ZQM be online tonight? Can we pass back MIT to you for the JFK arrivals?
Braden K | ZBW TA

 — 01/02/2026 16:49
Lots of oceanic demand into JFK for the start of the event

Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/02/2026 16:49
Do we have any update on an NTMO for tonight?

Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/02/2026 17:03
FYI - is EXTOL a typo for the JFK passback? EXTOL is on the FLOSI# for EWR, the JFK transition is MEMMS 
Also @Matt H | I1 ?No Access TMIs here for you to view. LMK if it doesn't let you in again and I'll DM you ??
Matt H | I1 — 01/02/2026 17:06
can see it, thx
Daniel G | ZBW I1

 — 01/02/2026 17:08
yeah sorry
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/02/2026 17:09
no worries ??
Matt H | I1 — 01/02/2026 17:11
@Arya C | ZME DATM just so you're aware I'm not sure what our staffing will be like tonight, as I didn't realize there's a team Canada hockey game starting at 0130z.
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/02/2026 17:12
No worries. Any help would be appreciated and if you can't get someone on later I'm sure we'll make do. Enjoy the game!
Daniel G | ZBW I1

Updated MIT into BOS for ROBUC and JFUND @Daniel | ZNY EC @Arya C | ZME DATM ???? ?No Access
Braden K | ZBW TA

 — 01/02/2026 17:20
?? we can reduce these, but with how much demand we have airborne into N90 we can't tube ourselves with extra traffic
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/02/2026 17:20
40 to PONCT is....steep but I'm sure everyone will be flying to JFK so it'll be fine
Daniel | ZNY EC — 01/02/2026 17:21
Yeah, and my philosophy is always to start with high MITs and reduce as able
Better to be proactive than reactive
Daniel G | ZBW I1

 — 01/02/2026 17:21
If you have a one off case with 2 aircraft just let us know and we can probably take them in with whatever, but if a stream pops up we will need the mileage
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/02/2026 17:21
of course, understandable
that should probably be via PONCT 40 MIT AS ONE right?
or do you want per route
Daniel G | ZBW I1

 — 01/02/2026 17:25
Oh yeah. I’ll put that in the actual NTML entry
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/02/2026 18:23
@NTMO anyone avail?

Forgot to mention but @Andreas | ZNY C3 is our TMU tonight
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/02/2026 20:18
log for later: 
ZJX-JFK through ZDC holding from 0100 EFC 0130 (currently 2 planes)
ZBW into JFK holding starting with VIR9 (expected 10 a/c) lasting 30 mins time now 0118z 
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/02/2026 20:57
ZOB got slammed by C90, that combined with D21 caused saturation
As well as the ETG stream from ZID
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/02/2026 20:58
Honestly the issue wasn't that they were difficult to do the passback for 66/77 for, even if they had been sequenced it wouldn't have helped. Just a lot of planes so sector saturation. 
Jonathan B | ZOB EC — 01/02/2026 20:59
Right, I wasn't saying C90 screwed us... was just saying that there was a lot of traffic from C90 combined with everything else
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/02/2026 21:00
oh with the sequencing I was referencing ZID
But yes same thing. MIT or no MIT problem was planes ??
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/02/2026 21:01
D/D tracking for JFK AAL1348 JFK-CLT taxi 0200z disconnected @ 0138
QTR15G JFK-OTHH taxied 0120 ish departed 0300 ish will verify with vatsim replay 
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/02/2026 21:36
vatsim replay was started at 0100z missed the first hour but still got most of the action which was 0115-0200
