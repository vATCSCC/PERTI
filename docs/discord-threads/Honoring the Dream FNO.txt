I feel like we just did this FNO lol
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/03/2026 14:22
me too loll
and what cherry blossom is the day after right
Dean V | ZHU DATM

 — 01/03/2026 14:24
Nice job scheduling.
More than likely avail for this
Arya C | ZME DATM — 01/03/2026 14:24
ZOB can also offer its services if needed for ZID / some ground control as DTW is normally quite popular
Hayden Y | ZID ATM — 01/03/2026 14:37
Yeah I was thinking we'll see alot from DTW.

The new route tool is super handy FYI - https://perti.vatcscc.org/route
I had to switch maps for it to work however

Example

Alejandro J | ZJX TA — 01/07/2026 16:41
this is what we are looking at so far for routes going to ATL through ZJX Airspace, @Roy P | ZMA DATM thoughts on routing people out of the MIA/FLL metroplex over the west via Q110? @Meg B | ZTL EC @Timothy M | ZTL I1 thoughts on that aswell?

Roy P | ZMA DATM

 — 01/07/2026 16:42
sure we can do that
if ZTL is good with it that is
Alejandro J | ZJX TA — 01/07/2026 17:10
Another possibility is we keep all ATL bound traffic from MIA/FLL going via SHRKS and we reroute guys out of MCO via the RDSOX
we're fine with either whichever works best for y'all @Meg B | ZTL EC @Timothy M | ZTL I1
Meg B | ZTL EC — 01/09/2026 13:39
I'm inclined to leave MCO alone and have MIA go over the west coast. But let me see if I can look up the historical data...not that history repeats itself or anything. One can never tell.
Matt B | ZJX C3 — 01/09/2026 13:55
There is a very minor debate on if it’s easier for us to reroute MCO traffic IF needed vs having ZMA (a Tier 2) reroute all the MIA traffic.
Timothy M | ZTL I1 — 01/13/2026 02:36
well if we start re-routing people from the start, it'll be easy if we just post it on simbrief during event period
Matt B | ZJX C3 — 01/13/2026 07:27
I guess it just depends on what you all want then, MIA-ATL expected to be the heaviest demand. Do you want them routed west to join the HOBBT/GNDLF? or would prefer MCO-ATL routed that way?
Timothy M | ZTL I1 — 01/13/2026 10:45
cc: @Meg B | ZTL EC
Meg B | ZTL EC — 01/14/2026 10:09
If there's a way to get simbrief to suggest the western route from MIA I think that would be best for the pilots. It looks like fewer added flying miles. And it might be better for how we need to do splits too.
Alex Y | ZNY I1 — 01/14/2026 10:20
Several DCC staff people have the permissions to add time-limited "TMU" route entries into the Simbrief database, it usually comes up within the first couple route suggestions when flight planning 
Short answer is yes
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/14/2026 10:47
Yeah just send the routes and I or anyone else with access can put em in
Matt B | ZJX C3 — 01/14/2026 11:20

KMIA HURCN4 SMELZ Q110 DAWWN BEORN GNDLF3 KATL
Well minus the arrival until we know the ops
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/14/2026 11:23
Rog yeah arrival won’t matter anyways cuz the database doesn’t have SID/STAR
I’ll put it in rn 
William P | ZDC C1 — 01/14/2026 14:00
What's ZDC's TMIs looking like from ZTL?
Meg B | ZTL EC — 01/14/2026 14:05
I get Tim will say 10, but I'm thinking 15-20.
Who am I kidding, Tim would say 5...!
William P | ZDC C1 — 01/14/2026 15:19
lol so start 10-15?
Alejandro J | ZJX TA — 01/14/2026 16:09
What are ZJX's TMI's looking like from ZTL?
(plz say let em fly)
Ford | ZTL C1 — 01/14/2026 16:14
Unfortunately if anywhere ZJX is likely where the MIT is needed, as it's those STARs that create the downwind and base streams to the south runway at ATL. NE and NW both feed to their own runway 
Eric S | ZME EC — 01/14/2026 16:41
How about for ZME?
Ford | ZTL C1 — 01/14/2026 17:28
I'll leave everything up to @Meg B | ZTL EC and @Timothy M | ZTL I1 who are actually planning the event
Hayden Y | ZID ATM — 01/15/2026 12:41
I don't see any TMI or anything for us, do yoou have an opening plan @Meg B | ZTL EC or just gonna let the near tripple digit AAR go wild? 
Abhi D | ZMA EC — 01/15/2026 13:42
I sent the routing requirements to ZMA, just to make sure, it’s only MIA - ATL, no change for FLL - ATL?
Eric S | ZME EC — 01/15/2026 16:10

ZHU will have staffing
Timothy M | ZTL I1 — 01/15/2026 21:42

Facilities are encouraged to use the PERTI Splits (PERTI/splits) for active splits, public routes system (PERTI/route) for published routes to be viewed by everyone, NAS Operations Dashboard (PERTI/nod) for situational awareness, & ground delay tool (PERTI/gdt) for measuring GS impacts
Matt B | ZJX C3 — 01/16/2026 08:17
one stop shop for splits people! we always wanted this feature! Thank you @Jeremy P | ZNY C1 for providing this
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/16/2026 08:17
And let me know what doesn’t work lol
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/16/2026 08:23
I see your scheduled ZJX split in the website but can you make sure the times are right? Or was that just for testing?
Matt B | ZJX C3 — 01/16/2026 08:24
I'm actually trying to see if we have it in there yet, I didnt see it, unless I am looking at the wrong spot...I was just making one
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/16/2026 08:24
But idk why it's showing up in scheduled if it's in the past; may be an issue on my side
Image
Matt B | ZJX C3 — 01/16/2026 08:25
oh ok yea that was a test, I am making a correct one now
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 01/16/2026 09:43
Slightly off topic but if this is ur goal with all the new tabs on that website id rlly make sure there’s some user guide to all of it
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 01/16/2026 09:44
I'm working on it.
Eric S | ZME EC — 01/16/2026 14:51
