Justin L | ZAB C3 — 11/15/2025 17:00
Here are our planned TMIs for Friday night. 

Plan is to have them take effect 30 mins after event start.

Not requesting anything from ZKC, ZFW, or ZHU to start as demand is usually low, but if the demand is there, expect 30-40 MIT for ABQ. This will mainly affect ZFW as I don't think we get anyone directly from ZHU going to ABQ. We should have enough room to make space for anyone going to PHX.

Winds are looking okay to force east flow at ABQ. If that changes and we need to run west that will slow things down considerably and TMIs will be increased.

Last year we floated the idea of running 30 per stream, 20 "if no comp" for HOGGZ/SCOLE and WOTRO/TENTS but were told it'd be better to run one or the other. We'll just start with 30 per (which is what we did last year) and see how it's going. If we can drop it to 20 we certainly will. Unless ZLA is comfortable running 30 per, 20 if no comp and nobody else has any objections.

Will get splits in here as soon as I know them. 
PHX via SCOLE, HOGGZ 30 MIT PER STREAM EXCL:PROPS VOLUME:VOLUME 0030-0400 ZAB:ZLA
PHX via WOTRO, TENTS 30 MIT PER STREAM EXCL:PROPS VOLUME:VOLUME 0030-0400 ZAB:ZLA

Dean V | ZHU DATM

 — 11/15/2025 17:29
Good lookin TMIs, Justin. PHX @30 MIT does seem a little high over Gallup, is that for staffing/saturation?
Justin L | ZAB C3 — 11/15/2025 17:30
PHX or ABQ?
Dean V | ZHU DATM

 — 11/15/2025 17:30
ABQ I understand, but a field with twice the AAR and same TMIs doesn’t make too much sense (hence ur comment abt no comp, which is good)
Dean V | ZHU DATM

 — 11/15/2025 17:30
PHX. PHX @30
Justin L | ZAB C3 — 11/15/2025 17:31
ZDV -> PHX feeds the same arrival as ABQ -> PHX. We need 15 into the TRACON on that arrival and ABQ -> PHX was the busiest stream last year. 
Dean V | ZHU DATM

 — 11/15/2025 17:32
Perfect.
Justin L | ZAB C3 — 11/15/2025 17:32
If ZDV-PHX traffic is extremely high we have an offload from ABQ-PHX we can implement and lower that
Dean V | ZHU DATM

 — 11/15/2025 17:33
Would it be better to put them on Brusr?
Denver peeps
that way you’re not running into space issues from ZLA and a heavy stream from ABQ
Justin L | ZAB C3 — 11/15/2025 17:33
LAS-PHX was the second busiest PHX arrival stream last year. BRUSR would add a lot of workload to ZLA I think. It would probably be better to just offload ABQ-PHX to the PINNG1
I've taken that reroute ABQ-PHX RW and it saved us close to an hour of flow time lol

Yeah, logically that makes the most sense. Just keep in mind the impact on final
Blake R | ZSE C3 — 11/16/2025 11:14
One potential curveball is lurking.  Weather at KDEN is flirting with snow for Thursday night or Friday.  If weather is bad, you know how weather-induced curveballs can create a cross fire :D.  It hasn't happened a lot historically, but there's always the chance.
Dean V | ZHU DATM

 — 11/16/2025 12:02
I have one very easy solution to that??
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 11/16/2025 12:32
Let me looks, but looking at the ensembles, PHX maybe MVFR/IFR.
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 11/16/2025 12:39
Yeah, PHX will be running ILS I think.
Brody B | ZLA EC — 11/16/2025 12:40
:concerned:
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 11/16/2025 12:44
We are playing the cutoff low roulette though. Doesn't hurt to look at an IMC plan.
I think either way someone loses.  EC solution, PHX is IMC. GFS solution Socal is E flow. Pick your poison.
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 11/16/2025 12:54
For reference.  Clusters 1, 2, & 4 are PHX IMC solutions, cluster 3 is LAX E solution.
Image
Brody B | ZLA EC — 11/16/2025 13:03
oh boy
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 11/16/2025 13:05
How does the GFS perform in these situations
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 11/16/2025 13:06
Poorly.  Everything does because the cutoff is notoriously difficult to predict.
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 11/16/2025 13:07
5 days out still? I just say wait and see
I haven’t been watching but it looks like that Canadian maritimes low proves influential and idk if it’s even made it onshore from the Pacific yet into good observation availability coverage
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 11/16/2025 13:10
Thats fair, but nearly every member of the ensemble solution is showing some kind of cutoff.  The question is more less just Where will the surface low be? A majority of members favor this AZ/mexico border idea that will bring CIGs and Precip to AZ, while some are favoring a more westward solution for the surface low, that will hang SE of SXC, bringing LAX, SAN, and SNA E.
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 11/16/2025 13:13
Exactly, so the devil being in the details means we should wait till we have better resolution of the details. Good to bring to attention, but I doubt it would be very valuable to be making deterministic decisions based on this this far out, given the high uncertainty.
I fully expect LAX to be a major origin in this event though
Because of the weather
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 11/16/2025 13:17
Agreed to some extent. Definitely should start thinking about plans for IMC though or IF LAX is east. In my network experience, LAX being east is like the beacon to all pilots to come fly lol.
Either way, I think wx will play a factor in this event.
Not even talking about DEN doing DEN things??
Brody B | ZLA EC — 11/16/2025 13:27
this exactly, it's been east all weekend and yesterday we had at least 10 departures for 12 hours
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 11/16/2025 23:20

Dean V | ZHU DATM

 — 11/17/2025 09:44
Aren’t they both on busy control positions?
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 11/17/2025 10:10
NBM will start spitting out info for CIGs tomorrow AM. Trend today is favoring the low being off the Socal coast.
@Brody B | ZLA EC Ya'll got an historical info on last time LAX was E during a T1 event?
Brody B | ZLA EC — 11/17/2025 10:34
unsure, @Nickolas C | ZLA ATM? 
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 11/17/2025 10:37
I don’t think it’s ever happened where LAXE happened during an event period
I can’t think of one time it’s happened
Brody B | ZLA EC — 11/17/2025 10:46
considering we had a weekend full of E ops it’ll be interesting
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 11/17/2025 11:23
Me neither but look in the NTML
Nickolas C | ZLA ATM — 11/17/2025 11:41
I can’t remember it happening since I’ve been around. LAX has always been west for primary or T1 events.

But, I do know there’s a video of an east ops event lurking somewhere on YouTube. It’s probably more than 10 years old.
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 11/17/2025 11:50
I don’t see any NTML entries other than west flow
Jordan J | ZAB EC

 — 11/17/2025 12:12
We are moving one of them.
Nickolas C | ZLA ATM — 11/17/2025 12:48
It would’ve happened long before NTML was a twinkle in your eye

planned ZLA stuff, may change
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 11/20/2025 00:33
Pretty decent chance LAX is E
KLAX...High confidence in TAF through 15Z, moderate confidence
thereafter. Timing of rain may be off +/- 3 hours. LIFR to IFR
conds possible with heavier rain. Lower confidence in wind
direction, but moderate confidence in S-E winds 20/13Z - 21/18Z.
A long period of strong east winds from around 21/04Z to 21/16Z
are possible, with low confidence. Moderate confidence in east
wind component remaining over 8 knots through the aforementioned
time frame.

From the LOX AFD this evening.

We shall have our initial ones out tomorrow morning
Thank you Brody!
Brody B | ZLA EC — 11/20/2025 06:36
we’re planing on it , ty
Justin L | ZAB C3 — 11/20/2025 08:31
I’m sorry I bring this up every time but can we please get the ESTWD, GABBL AS ONE switched to like 20 (or whatever you need) PER STREAM. ESTWD and GABBL are worked by 2 different sectors that are gonna be busy with PHX arrivals and it would take a lot of extra coordination between the two. It would be the equivalent of us asking for SCOLE and HOGGZ AS ONE and you having 2 separate sectors working each stream
Brody B | ZLA EC — 11/20/2025 08:49
totally gotcha, will write something new up later today
thanks for lmk
Brody B | ZLA EC — 11/20/2025 16:09

this should work
i plan to reduce the MITs on the HLYWD quickly. wanted to have a bit of a buffer for east ops
Justin L | ZAB C3 — 11/20/2025 16:15
Looks great thanks
Brody B | ZLA EC — 11/20/2025 16:16
ofc
Justin L | ZAB C3 — 11/20/2025 16:28
This is our plan for now. Subject to change. Will finalize TMIs sometime tomorrow morning once we have a better idea of what the TAF looks like
Image
Brandon | ZFW DATM — 11/21/2025 08:22
Any specific Route Requests out of ZFW tonight?
Justin L | ZAB C3 — 11/21/2025 09:00
No TMIs for ZFW to start as demand is usually low. Will implement something if we need to but it won't be too crazy. Most people out of D10 should be filing over EWM DRRVR PINNG1. If for whatever reason a bunch of people start filing KATZZ2 BRHMA CNX ZUN EAGUL6 and demand from ZDV is high we might have you reroute them back over EWM DRRVR PINNG. But we have internal ABQ-PHX reroutes that can help with that too
Brandon | ZFW DATM — 11/21/2025 09:01
Ill let my guys know that all PHX goes EWM DRRVR PINNG1  That way you guys wont have to fuss with us if you get busy out west
Justin L | ZAB C3 — 11/21/2025 09:02
Great thanks
Blake R | ZSE C3 — 11/21/2025 09:55
ZDV going with the standard 2-way split tonight 
Image
Cameron N | ZLC ATM — 11/21/2025 10:43
ZLA, any pass back on TENTS for ZLC?  We will be staffed. FWIW, ZAB ZLC is basically what I call a T1.5 for PHX.  We were in CFR all summer for PHX
Justin L | ZAB C3 — 11/21/2025 11:53
PHX winds/weather look good to force west flow VMC. ABQ east VMC. Previously posted TMIs are the plan for now. Slight changes may be needed closer to event start once we have a better idea of where traffic is coming from. Split still the same as above for now.

thanks
Justin L | ZAB C3 — 11/21/2025 15:43
Anyone who keeps tabs on the popular streamers know if any of them are planning on flying in? I don’t keep track of that at all
Brody B | ZLA EC — 11/21/2025 15:47
XP72 is the only one who usually makes a dent and he notifies 30m priorto his stream. nothing yet...

it's better.. i promise
you don't want ZDV distracted sequencing 15 planes to ZLA instead of focusing on inbound traffic to ZAB
