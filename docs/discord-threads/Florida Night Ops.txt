Woop woop. Let’s knock this out of the park. We have TMI from the last time we did a ZMA / ZJX FNO that included ZTL. Might be worth looking over again.
Abhi D | ZMA EC — 10/17/2025 21:41
Would anyone be available to serve as ZMA TMU should we need it? Our current rostered TMU is not 100% sure of their availability on Friday so in case he doesn’t make it we were looking for one
Michael B | VATUSA5 — 10/17/2025 21:58
@NTMO  ^^^^
Simon R | ZJX C1 — 10/17/2025 22:11
Depends on ZJX staffing
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 10/18/2025 08:29
I get home at like 1900ET I could help out. But someone else would need to do the setup
Abhi D | ZMA EC — 10/19/2025 10:16
Thank you, after talking with @Roy P | ZMA DATM, we have a different plan if our rostered TMU is not able to make it. So thank you everyone but no longer in need of one
Jeremy P | ZNY C1 — 10/19/2025 10:21
Ok
Carson B | ZDC EC

@Patrick M | ZJX EC Any planned TMIs as of now?
Patrick M | ZJX EC

 — 10/20/2025 15:04
Not as of yet. Will discuss with our team and let you know
Alejandro J | ZJX TA — 10/21/2025 16:51
currently working on the TMI's for F11/JAX, we'll get those once we determine what we may need from neighbors. Any passback MIT will be coordinated once we know what ZMA is gonna need from us.

Also ZJX here is the planned split for ZMA on Friday, we've improved the formatting as much as we can at the moment and I've received feedback this is much easier to understand than our previous ones. 

The sectors in black on the left are the ones online, and underneath it lists what they cover. But everything is correctly color matched now, so the splits depcited are accurate to what the position is working, any questions let me know happy to clarify

Thanks! We don't have a split quite yet but will share it as soon as we do...still waiting to see how many ACE controllers we get
Simon R | ZJX C1 — 10/21/2025 17:52
How many are rostered so far…?
I believe ZMA was also looking for 2-3 more enroute, not sure if they managed to get them
Patrick M | ZJX EC

 — 10/21/2025 17:53
We have 3 officially signed up, 5 if you count the 2 "if needed" (they officially requested a different position but will work center if we need them to)
Simon R | ZJX C1 — 10/21/2025 17:54
So 2 for the full event + myself for at least half and then 2 others as “maybe” basically?
Patrick M | ZJX EC

 — 10/21/2025 17:55
yep exactly...I put in an ACE request for 2-3 more people as well
Simon R | ZJX C1 — 10/21/2025 17:55
@Abhi D | ZMA EC are you also still short 1 or did you guys get sufficient?
I’m assuming F11/JAX tracon / cab are both sufficient staffed right?
Alejandro J | ZJX TA — 10/21/2025 17:57
still figuring that out
Abhi D | ZMA EC — 10/21/2025 17:58
We are looking for 1 more Miami Center and then we should be good

MIA LTFC (landing traffic) is usually what's put in those TMIs ??
also, FROGZ is wayyyyy too far for us to sequence to.
Patrick M | ZJX EC

 — 10/21/2025 19:16
I will talk to the team...this was based off of last years FNO. Will get back to you!

@Kona / @Patrick M | ZJX EC  / @Simon R | ZJX C1 you guys can lower MIT on the FROGZ to 25. We can accommodate 20 if that is easier for you guys. 
Patrick M | ZJX EC

 — 10/24/2025 21:35
We'll drop it down to 20.
Robby | ZMA ATM

 — 10/24/2025 22:12
Do you guys still need 25 into F11? No problem if so, just checking before we delay some planes.
Patrick M | ZJX EC

 — 10/24/2025 22:15
We canceled all MIT into MCO about 5 minutes into the event
So send em!
Robby | ZMA ATM

 — 10/24/2025 22:17
Just saw that, thank you.
Cancel all ZMA MIT
